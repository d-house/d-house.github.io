          <p style="vertical-align:top; margin-top:10px; ">

          </p>
          <h4>Family</h4>
          <p>
            Don's wife Lynette House is an accomplished artist. They have two children.
            Ian is a software engineer in New Hampshire, and
            <a href="http://felicehouse.com" target="_blank">Felice is a painter
            on the faculty of Texas A&amp;M</a>.
            Ian is married to Gina House and they have given us two grandchildren, Timmy and Ben.
            Felice's husband is Dana Younger who was one of the founders of
            <a href="http://bluegenieart.com" target = "_blank">Blue Genie Art Industries</a>
            in Austin, and is now with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
            He is also one of the principals operating the yearly
            <a href="http://bluegenieartbazaar.com" target = "_blank">Blue Genie Art Bazaar</a>,
            which is a unique Christmas shopping venue in Austin.
            Dana has two boys, Jasper and Wiley who are welcome new members of the family.
          </p>
          <h4>Faith</h4>
          <p>
          Don is a longtime member of the
          <a href="http://www.bahai.org/" target="_blank">Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith</a>.
          The essential teachings of
          the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith are that there is one God, one Humankind, and one
          Religion - promulgated by God to Humankind in a progressive unfoldment. Thus, Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s
          see religion as progressive, and not static, and that God has unfolded this religion to
          mankind over the ages to foster a civilization that is continually advancing in its
          spiritual, moral, and intellecutal foundations. The vehicle for this unfoldment is the
          Manifestation of God or Prophet. In our history the most familiar to us are known by
          the names Abraham, Moses,
          Krishna, Buddah, Zoroaster, Jesus, Mohammed, and most recently
          the B&aacute;b and Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h.
          Just as Christians
          understand that Jesus came out of Judaeism and illumnated its teachings, and just as
          Moslems understand that Mohammed illuminated the teachings of Jesus and advanced His
          laws and spiritual practices, Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s
          believe that the B&aacute;b and then Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h have brought a new set of
          teachings illuminating the teachings of all of the Prophets before them, and that these
          teachings will form the basis for a new age of Humankind.
